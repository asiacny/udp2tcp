-- ChangeLog for udp2tcp --
---------------------------
$Id$

This document contains all the changes made to udp2tcp in
reverse chronological order, with the latest change at the top.
All changes are grouped under the release they first appeared, or under
the "unversioned" entry if they are still available only via SVN.

-- Legend: --
The first character in every line represents the type of change:
  b = bug (a tracker ID is supplied in the description, if applicable)
  f = feature request (ID supplied as well)
  d = natural step in the developement (or: I always wanted to make that change
      but never had the time)
  c = correction (may vary from a typo to a serious code refactoring)
  u = undefined (AKA programmer's lazyness proof)
The second character denotes the priority of the change.
  ! = critical (like the correction of a security bug)
  + = important
  = = normal (most changes fall into this category)
  - = less important
  . = niced at the highest value
The third character represents the impact that the change had on the code.
  ! = even the author does not understand what he did :)
  + = some things might be broken after that
  = = the impact is local and does not require a full check of alien code
  - = the change is usually visible in a function scope and therefore is
      harmless
  . = typo
